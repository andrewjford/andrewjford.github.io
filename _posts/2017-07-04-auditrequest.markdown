I am nearing the completion of my first Rails web application. It is named AuditRequest. AuditRequest is an application to facilitate file transfers and communications between CPA firms and organizations being audited.

CPA firms (the auditors) request numerous files and documents over the course of an audit. Many auditors use software in order to help organize and keep track of requests, as well as provide a more secure transfer. I have worked on both sides of an audit in my past career, and having such software is beneficial to both parties.

The quality of the user interface of audit file sharing software is very important. Since there are other avenues to manage audit requests (accountants love their spreadsheets), users can quickly stray away from using a specific software. And emails will almost always be easier for sending files. The best tools have a fast and simple interface with great communication and summary features. This was my focus while I created this app. 

The first version of AuditRequest is intended to be fully functional outside actually storing uploaded files. For now, the link to upload a file is a dummy button that simply changes the status of the related request. Below is a link to the github page.
